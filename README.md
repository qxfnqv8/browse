# Browse AI No-Code Web Scraping: Save Time, Automate Data Extraction, Trusted by 250,000+ Users

So you're tired of manually copying data from websites? Yeah, we've all been there—clicking, scrolling, copying, pasting, repeat until your eyes glaze over. What if I told you there's a tool that can do all that boring stuff while you grab a coffee?

Browse AI is a no-code web scraping platform that lets literally anyone—yes, even if you've never written a line of code—extract and monitor data from websites automatically. Think of it as your personal robot assistant that never sleeps, never complains, and definitely doesn't need coffee breaks.

## What Makes Browse AI Different?

Here's the thing: most web scraping tools are built for developers. Browse AI? It's built for regular humans. You record what you want once (seriously, just click around like you normally would), and the platform learns it. Then it repeats that task automatically, on schedule, forever.

The platform works on virtually any of the 1.8 billion websites out there. E-commerce sites, job boards, real estate listings, competitor websites—you name it. And when those websites change their layout? Browse AI adapts automatically. No broken scrapers, no emergency fixes at 2 AM.

Over 250,000 users are already using it, from solo entrepreneurs to marketing teams at major companies. The use cases are everywhere: market research, competitor monitoring, lead generation, price tracking, content aggregation.

## Real Users, Real Results

One real estate professional put it simply: "Browse AI is not just a tool but a complete solution that enhances productivity and decision-making capabilities." They particularly praised how well it handles pagination and lazy loading—technical stuff that just works without you thinking about it.

A marketing coordinator shared: "The tool provided me with exactly what I'm looking for, an easy and intuitive way to scrape information online. What really elevates it is the customer support."

Even users from non-technical backgrounds feel like tech geniuses: "I was told to find a web scraper for a task and the first one I used was giving me so much trouble. When I found Browse AI, using their tools I felt like a tech genius. Easy to figure out and use."

The platform scores consistently high across review platforms, with users especially appreciating the intuitive interface, Google Sheets integration, and the ability to set up automations in minutes rather than hours.

## Browse AI Pricing Plans 2026

Let's talk money. Browse AI offers flexible pricing for different needs, and here's what you actually get:

### Pricing Comparison Table

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (20% Discount) | Credits/Month | Websites | Users | Best For |
|------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 50 | 2 | 3 | Testing & light use |
| **Personal** | $48 | $19/month ($228/year) | 2,000 (or 1,000-2,000 annual) | 5 | 3 | Freelancers & solopreneurs |
| **Professional** | $87 | $69/month ($828/year) | 5,000-30,000 (or 5,000-30,000 annual) | 10 | 10 | Growing teams & businesses |
| **Premium** | Custom | Starting at $500/month | 600,000+ | Custom | Custom | Enterprise with managed services |

**Pro tip**: Going annual saves you 20% automatically. That's almost 2.5 months free every year.

### What's a "Credit" Anyway?

Each credit lets you extract 10 rows of data or capture one screenshot. So if you're scraping a product page with 50 items, that's 5 credits. Monitor those same 50 products daily? You're looking at about 1,500 credits per month.

Some websites use premium proxies (marked as "Premium" sites) and cost 2-10 credits minimum per run. These are typically sites that actively try to block scraping.

### Special Discounts Available

Browse AI offers additional savings:
- **Educational institutions**: 20% discount on any paid plan
- **Non-profits**: 20% discount on any paid plan  
- **Startups**: 20% discount on any paid plan
- **Annual billing**: Automatic 20% discount (already reflected in the table above)

According to recent coupon sites, there have been verified promo codes like **ROBOTS10** (10% off) and **ROBOTS20** (20% off) floating around, though availability varies. The platform rarely issues promotional codes, so when they do appear, they're worth grabbing.

Additionally, 👉 [NachoNacho offers 15% cashback + 10% discount through their marketplace](https://browse.ai), and 👉 [Freelance Stack has negotiated an exclusive 20% off deal](https://browse.ai) for new customers.

**Real estate professionals** monitor new listings, price changes, and market trends without manually checking 20 different websites every morning.

## The Technical Stuff (That Just Works)

Browse AI handles the nasty technical challenges behind the scenes:

- **Residential Proxies**: Rotating IPs so you don't get blocked

- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically scrolls and loads more content
- **Form Filling**: Can log in, fill forms, navigate multi-step processes
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart throttling to avoid triggering anti-bot measures
- **Data Retention**: 90 days on standard plans (customizable on Premium)

Security is bank-level. They use Auth0 for authentication, AWS datacenters, TLS 1.2 encryption, AES-256 for stored credentials. SOC 2 Type II compliant, GDPR and CCPA compliant.

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's literally all you need to do:

1. 👉 [Sign up for free](https://browse.ai) (no credit card required)
2. Install the Chrome extension
3. Navigate to a website and click "Record"
4. Browse the site like normal—click what you want to extract
5. Stop recording, name your robot
6. Set a schedule or run on-demand

That's it. First-time users typically have their first automation running in under 5 minutes.

Or skip custom robots entirely and use one of the 250+ prebuilt templates for popular sites and use cases.

## When Browse AI Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)

**Perfect for:**
- Non-technical users who need data extraction
- Teams tired of manual data collection
- Businesses monitoring competitors, prices, or listings
- Anyone needing structured data from websites regularly
- Projects requiring reliable, scheduled data updates

**Maybe not ideal for:**
- One-time data extraction (the free plan works, but might be overkill)
- Extremely high-volume scraping (millions of pages daily—though Premium plans handle this)
- Real-time millisecond-level updates
- Projects requiring custom JavaScript execution beyond clicks/forms

## Browse AI vs. The Alternatives

Compared to coding your own scrapers: way faster, no maintenance headaches, automatically adapts to changes.

Compared to hiring a developer: fraction of the cost, instant setup, you control everything.

Compared to other no-code scrapers: Browse AI consistently ranks higher for ease of use and reliability. The automatic adaptation to website changes is particularly praised versus competitors where scrapers break constantly.

## Support and Resources

Basic email support on Personal plans, priority email support on Professional, premium support with dedicated account managers on Premium plans.

The help center is comprehensive with tutorials, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides. The community is active and supportive.

Users consistently mention the support team goes above and beyond. One reviewer specifically called out team member Kimber: "incredibly helpful and prompt, and her genuine care for the end user is remarkable."

## Making the Decision

If you're spending more than an hour per week manually collecting data from websites, Browse AI probably pays for itself immediately. At $19/month for the annual Personal plan, you're looking at roughly the cost of one latte per week.

The free plan is generous enough to actually test real workflows, not just kick the tires. Two websites, unlimited robots, 50 credits per month. Try it, build a real robot, see if it clicks for you.

For teams? The Professional plan at $69/month annual gives you 10 websites, 10 users, and up to 30,000 credits monthly depending on your selected tier. Most growing businesses find this sweet spot works perfectly.

👉 [Start with the free plan here](https://browse.ai) and see what you think. No credit card required means literally zero risk.

The bottom line: if websites have data you need, and you'd rather not spend your life copy-pasting, Browse AI is worth your time. It won't write your novel or make your coffee, but it'll definitely free up your day for the stuff that actually matters.

**Quick reminder**: Annual plans automatically include 20% savings, educational institutions and non-profits get an additional 20% off, and occasionally promotional codes appear (like ROBOTS20 for 20% off when available). Worth checking before you commit.

Now stop reading and go build your first robot. Your future self will thank you.
